      "1. **Ensure Correct Data Context**: The original code attempted to use an `extracted_road_network_gdf` to get school names, which is conceptually incorrect. I corrected this by ensuring a proper mapping from `columbia_schools_gdf` to walkability scores.\n",

      "2. **Use Appropriate Data Structures for Merging Data**: I ensured joins and data accesses were done correctly, especially when creating mappings of IDs to names.\n",

      "3. **Consistent Projection Checking**: Ensured that operations between spatial datasets were handled with matching CRS, following the provided guidelines without unnecessary transformations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Utilized `pd.concat()` Instead of `append()`**: Since `append()` is being deprecated in future versions of Pandas, I transitioned to `pd.concat()` for constructing GeoDataFrames.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Ensured All Non-Spatial Data Columns Were Managed Properly**: Ensured that the non-spatial data handling, specifically for data types in columns used for joining, met requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Addressed Potential `NameError` in Basemap**: When adding basemaps, I included exception handling to address any NameErrors if libraries like `contextily` were not defined in earlier versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Properly Assign Variables**: Fixed errors related to missing variables, ensuring correct variable scoping and usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Consistent Error Handling**: Added checks to handle cases where specific columns might not exist, providing warnings when basemaps could not be added.\n",
