      "3. **Consistency**: Ensured consistency in methods for handling GeoDataFrames to avoid similar issues in future versions.\n",
      "4. **Visualization**: Improved plot discriminability with legend and figure setup by adjusting the size and specifying clear axis labels, ensuring clarity in the output maps.\n",
