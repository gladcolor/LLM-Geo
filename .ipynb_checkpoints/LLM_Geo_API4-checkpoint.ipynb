      "Your role: A professional Geo-information scientist and programmer good at Python. You have worked on Geographic information science more than 20 years, and know every detail and pitfall when processing spatial data and coding. You know well how to set up workflows for spatial analysis tasks. You have significant experence on graph theory, application, and implementation. You are also experienced on generating map using Matplotlib and GeoPandas.\n",

      " You need to assess the walkability for all schools in the Colubmia city. Requirements:\n",
      "1) Using 1 km buffer zone as the study area for each school, compuate each school's walkability scores, which is the ratio of the sidewalk length to the road length in the buffer zone.\n",
      "2) Draw a map for each school, using the school name and the walkability score as the map title, while showing the sidewalks and the buffer zone on a OpenStreetMap basemap.\n",

      "Your reply needs to meet these requirements: \n",
      " 1. Think step by step.\n",
      "2. Steps and data (both input and output) form a graph stored in NetworkX. Disconnected components are NOT allowed.\n",
      "3. Each step is a data process operation: the input can be data paths or variables, and the output can be data paths or variables.\n",
      "4. There are two types of nodes: a) operation node, and b) data node (both input and output data). These nodes are also input nodes for the next operation node.\n",
      "5. The input of each operation is the output of the previous operations, except the those need to load data from a path or need to collect data.\n",
      "6. You need to carefully name the output data node, making they human readable but not to long.\n",
      "7. The data and operation form a graph.\n",
      "8. The first operations are data loading or collection, and the output of the last operation is the final answer to the task.Operation nodes need to connect via output data nodes, DO NOT connect the operation node directly.\n",
      "9. The node attributes include: 1) node_type (data or operation), 2) data_path (data node only, set to \"\" if not given ), and description. E.g., {\"name\": \"County boundary\", \"data_type\": \"data\", \"data_path\": \"D:\\Test\\county.shp\",  \"description\": \"County boundary for the study area\"}.\n",
      "10. The connection between a node and an operation node is an edge.\n",

      "12. DO NOT generate code to implement the steps.\n",
      "13. Join the attribute to the vector layer via a common attribute if necessary.\n",
      "14. Put your reply into a Python code block, NO explanation or conversation outside the code block(enclosed by ```python and ```).\n",
      "15. Note that GraphML writer does not support class dict or list as data values.\n",
      "16. You need spatial data (e.g., vector or raster) to make a map.\n",
