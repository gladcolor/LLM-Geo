      "### Explanation of Corrections:\n",
      "1. **Merge Correction**: The `merge` function was updated to include `how='left'` to ensure that all records from the `walmart_centroids` are retained even if there is no matching record in `dist_to_roads`. This avoids the creation of NaN values in `'dist_to_road'`, allowing us to filter by it properly later.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **CRS Check**: Ensured the correct handling of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS). Checked and ensured that the transformation of CRS happens only when it is necessary (though the error wasn't stemming from this, checking for these pitfalls is crucial).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Data Integrity**: Throughout the data processing steps, ensured that NaN values are appropriately managed by using `dropna(subset=['dist_to_road'])` post-merge to handle any unmatched joins correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "These adjustments ensure that the program runs without error by maintaining the integrity of data frames throughout the spatial analysis workflow.\n",

      "1. **Correcting Merging Logic:** The 'dist_to_road' was handled incorrectly due to inappropriate merging or not creating the column correctly at the necessary stage. I ensured this column is created properly in the compute_distance_to_roads function.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Data Integrity Check Before Dropping NaNs:** Ensured that the 'dist_to_road' column exists before attempting to drop NaN values, which was causing the KeyError.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Preservation of CRS and Geometry:** Make sure the handling of spatial data respects CRS needs, ensuring compatibility before operations by removing redundant CRS checks which aren't needed when loading/transforming single-layer datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Maintaining Original Function Structure:** Ensured that the function signatures and data handling align with the specified requirements by maintaining clarity and logic integrity.\n",
